excerpt: "Ways in which Data Science will help Cybersecurity"
---

Before the establishment of data science, things were done based on assumptions, and they were central to many organizations' information security strategies. As a result, decisions were subjective as they were formed around doubt, fear and uncertainty.
<br /> 
With the introduction of data science, the dark and ambiguous world of these fears, uncertainty, and doubt based assumptions have become significantly illuminated. Consequently, decisions have been rid of the solid nature, and instead, decisions have become factual.

<b>Data science</b> is the field of study that combines domain expertise, programming skills, and knowledge of mathematics and statistics to extract meaningful insights from data.
<br />

<b>Cyber Security</b> is the application of technologies, processes and controls to protect systems, networks, programs, devices and data from cyber-attacks. It aims to reduce the risk of cyber-attacks and protect against the unauthorised exploitation of systems, networks and technologies.<br />
The result of integrating the techniques of data science and cyber security is <strong>Cybersecurity Data Science(CSDS)</strong>.

CSDS is a rapidly emerging profession focused on applying data science to prevent, detect, and remediate expanding and evolving cybersecurity threats.
CSDS is increasingly formally recognized as a cybersecurity job speciality, for instance in the <i><a href="https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-181r1" target="_blank">NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework,NIST</a></i>.

**General aspects of CSDS as an emerging professional practice:**
- CSDS is data-focused, applies quantitative, algorithmic, and probabilistic methods, attempts to quantify risk, focuses on producing targeted and efficacious alerts, promotes inferential methods to categorize behavioural patterns, and ultimately seeks to optimize cybersecurity operations.
- CSDS seeks situational awareness and assumes persistent and prolific threats which may be human, automated or ‘cyborg’ in origin.
- CDSD goals connect historically with cybersecurity continuous monitoring and forensics functions in particular.
- Applied CSDS involves addressing cybersecurity challenges with data science prescriptions and implies a gap analysis is conducted.
- CSDS has emerged from two-parent domains which themselves are undergoing rapid transformation.

# Impact of Data Science in Cybersecurity
- **Predictive and Active Intrusion Detection Systems**<br />
Hackers use various methods and tools to break into systems.
They can change their technique at any time. To bridge the gap between an attack and response, intrusion detection is required.
Machine learning algorithms, a feature of data science, helps in detecting loopholes in an information security environment to contribute to the strengthening of its security in different organizations.

- **Relationship between Big Data and Cyber Security**<br />
With the application of Data Analytics and several Machine Learning tools, an organization can conduct a thorough analysis of the collection of information. Professionals can examine data closely to reveal trends, patterns and actionable intel.

- **Protecting Valuable Information**<br />
Another concern of a data attack is the loss of extremely valuable data & information, which can be damaging to the organization. The traditional security measures such as complex signatures and encryption have helped bring an end to probing information and the various methods used by attackers in attacking valuable information.

- **Behavioural Analytics**<br />
It is good to be able to detect & identify malware but understanding the behaviour of the attacker is another. With data science, an organization can now easily analyze a vast amount of data.

- **Avoiding Laboratory Scenarios for Real-World Scenarios**<br />
    Data science enables the ability to move away from the laboratory scenarios which are fundamentally based on science and hypothesis and instead rely on real-world examples.

    These real-world scenarios are extracted from historical data which algorithms use to display the events that have taken place in the previous scenarios of attacks, and the way the organization responded and possibly recovered. With that, organizations can gain the true idea and know about their information security landscape much better, the benefits of which pays dividends in terms of better security.

    To identify malware and spam, organizations can take advantage of data science by collecting data from a variety of samples purposely for deep learning and training to detect the malware on time.

# Future of Data Science in Cybersecurity
Data science helps analyze big data to root out all kinds of vulnerabilities. Conversely, data security software such as VPN services helps protect the network from the source of big data. Even though there is a long way to go, data science is the in-thing in cybersecurity and by incorporating this into your programs.

As much value as data science has in the cybersecurity field already, there are yet vast amounts of opportunities and benefits in the future. With data analytics & different machine learning tools, organizations can conduct a proper analysis of the information they collect.

Data science can make things that were previously impossible, possible. Such things include flagging new threats depending on how similar they are to known exploits and their patterns.
<br />

**With the advancement of technology, cybercriminals will have to keep up with the pace but how exactly would data science change to meet the needs?**
<br />

Datasets will become larger and algorithms will become sharper, while detection systems have a high tendency to improve. In the future, the Security Operations Centre (SOC) and its elements may become incredibly automated and not only that, triage and automatic mitigation.

Data science is continually improving, and as the years roll by, the relevance in data security is becoming increasingly pronounced. In fact, according to research, artificial intelligence is forecast to reach about $35 billion by 2025.

The fact that data scientists play a massively versatile role or an analyst, interpreter, technical expert, and the likes, makes problem-solving the easiest for them. With the knowledge of data science, programmers can enhance their techniques and improve their skills better to create more effective programs that can help protect against cyber threats.
