## The morning of 6th October '19

The event kicked off at 10:00 am in the beautiful workspace of CoffeeBeans, HSR Layout. The place bustled with lots of college students and professionals. Everyone was brimming with enthusiasm and were ready to dive into open source. 

There were mentors and guides from the Mozilla community assisting the participants throughout the event. The attendees, both beginners to open-source veterans alike, explored various Mozilla projects on GitHub and contributed to them, guided by Mozillians. 

There were talks and discussions based around the following topics:
- [Mozilla mission](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/mission/)
- [Open Source](https://blog.glugmvit.com/opensource/)
- [Open Design](https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/)
- [Deep Speech](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech)
- [Common Voice](https://voice.mozilla.org/en)
- [Rust](https://research.mozilla.org/rust/)
- [Bug Hunting](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/home)
- [Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/)

Mozillians, Akshay, Jyotsna, and Abhijeet, enlightened people about the projects of Mozilla and motivated them with their words.

Overall, it was an interesting event. As much as people learned, they also enjoyed brainstorming ideas over tea and pizza.

## Agenda

The event consisted of the participants constantly guided by the mentors on getting involved with Mozilla open source projects, with lightning talks in between coding sessions.

## Am I eligible to be a part of the Hacktoberfest?

Yes, you are! In fact anyone can contribute to open source. It's all about celebrating open source and giving it back. It does not have to be a code, it could even be a documentation or a little spelling fix.

## How long will Hacktoberfest go?

The entire October of 2019! You can contribute any time in this month. All you need to do is create four pull requests in order to win a cool T-shirt.
